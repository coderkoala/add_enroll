### Augments Program Enrollment

---

- Adds fields sales invoice, customer into Program Enrollment
- Allows for generation of sales invoice instead of using the fee structure JV entry
- Is completely optional and noninstrusive to the original software.
- Adds field "item" to Fee Category and Courses, so they can be used in Sales Invoice
- Note the new functionality ignores fee categories or courses that have no item assigned.
